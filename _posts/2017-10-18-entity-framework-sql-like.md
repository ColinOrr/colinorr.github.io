I found out this week that using the `LIKE` operator in an Entity Framework
query is maddeningly difficult üò≥.  I reckon there are three options, each with
different trade-offs and levels of difficulty.

## Option 1: Entity SQL

According to Microsoft the [Entity SQL Language][1] is a storage-independent
query language that is similar to SQL.  It allows you to write queries like this:

```c#
var query = context.PersonQuery.Where(
    "it.FirstName LIKE @pattern",
    new ObjectParameter("pattern", "Col%")
);
```

*where `it` represents the entity being queried.*

Unfortunately this won't work with your normal Entity Framework datasets,
instead you have to expose an additional `ObjectSet` for each type of entity you
wish to query:

```c#
public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    // Normal sets used in EF code-first
    public DbSet<Person> People { get; set; }

    // Special Entity SQL object sets
    public ObjectContext ObjectContext   => ((IObjectContextAdapter)this).ObjectContext;
    public ObjectSet<Person> PersonQuery => ObjectContext.CreateObjectSet<Person>();
}
```

Advantages:  
‚úî Really easy to setup  
‚úî Works with all databases supported by EF  

Disadvantages:  
ùòü No in-memory version for unit testing  
ùòü Cannot be mixed with standard LINQ to make more complex queries  
ùòü Uses magic strings that won't survive a refactor and aren't type checked  
ùòü Has a rather verbose syntax for passing parameters  

## Option 2: SQL Functions

Entity Framework ships with a set of [SQL Functions][2] that can be used in LINQ
queries.  When Entity Framework executes the query, it will use the database
function with the matching name.

As there's no `LIKE` function available, we have to use [PATINDEX][3] instead
which performs a pattern match and returns the position of the first occurrence:

```c#
var query =
    from person in context.People
    where SqlFunctions.PatIndex("C%", person.FirstName) > 0
    select person;
```

Advantages:  
‚úî No setup required  
‚úî Standard LINQ so it can be mixed into more complex queries  
‚úî Strongly typed and refactor safe  

Disadvantages:  
ùòü No in-memory version for unit testing, it throws a not supported exception  
ùòü Only works with SQL Server  

## Option 3: Write a Custom SQL Function

Neither of the options above really float my boat.  The lack of support for
in-memory sequences makes it impossible to unit test complex queries without
using the database... I'd like to be able to write a query like this:

```c#
var query =
    from person in context.People
    where person.FirstName.Like("Col%")
    select person;
```

First we have to implement an in-memory version of the `Like` function to
support unit testing.  It's reasonably easy to do this using regular expressions:

```c#
public static class Functions
{
    [DbFunction("CodeFirstDatabaseSchema", "Like")]
    public static bool Like(this string target, string pattern)
    {
        // Escape all the special regex characters by default
        pattern = Regex.Escape(pattern);

        // Add regex equivalents for the various SQL LIKE characters
        pattern = pattern.Replace("%", ".+");
        pattern = pattern.Replace("_", ".");
        pattern = pattern.Replace(@"\[", "[");
        pattern = pattern.Replace(@"\]", "]");
        pattern = pattern.Replace(@"[\^", "[^");

        // Match against the entire string
        pattern = "^" + pattern + "$";

        return Regex.IsMatch(target, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
    }
}
```

The `[DbFunction]` attribute tells Entity Framework to map this method to a
database function called "Like" when transposed into a SQL query... so lets add
this function to the database:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[Like]
(
    @target nvarchar(max),
    @pattern nvarchar(max)
)
RETURNS BIT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (SELECT CASE WHEN @target LIKE @pattern THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
END
```

In an ideal world that would be it, however Entity Framework needs a bit more
metadata to map this SQL function to the C# one.  There are third party libraries
that can add this metadata automatically, like [this one][4] by moozzyk, but they
don't support extension methods.

Here's how to do it explicitly for our Like function (brace yourself):

```c#
public class FunctionsConvention : IStoreModelConvention<EdmModel>
{
    public void Apply(EdmModel item, DbModel model)
    {
        var payload = new EdmFunctionPayload
        {
            Schema = "dbo",
            StoreFunctionName = "Like",
            Parameters = new[]
            {
                FunctionParameter.Create("target" , getPrimitiveType(model, PrimitiveTypeKind.String), ParameterMode.In),
                FunctionParameter.Create("pattern", getPrimitiveType(model, PrimitiveTypeKind.String), ParameterMode.In),
            },
            ReturnParameters = new[]
            {
                FunctionParameter.Create("result", getPrimitiveType(model, PrimitiveTypeKind.Boolean), ParameterMode.ReturnValue)
            },
        };

        item.AddItem(EdmFunction.Create("Like", "CodeFirstDatabaseSchema", item.DataSpace, payload, null));
    }

    private static EdmType getPrimitiveType(DbModel model, PrimitiveTypeKind typeKind)
    {
        return model
            .ProviderManifest
            .GetStoreType(TypeUsage.CreateDefaultTypeUsage(PrimitiveType.GetEdmPrimitiveType(typeKind)))
            .EdmType;
    }
}
```

Finally this convention needs to be registered in your data context:

```c#
public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Person> People { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Conventions.Add(new FunctionsConvention());
    }
}
```

Advantages:  
‚úî In-memory version for unit testing or filtering results after the query executes  
‚úî Standard LINQ so it can be mixed into more complex queries  
‚úî Strongly typed and refactor safe  
‚úî Works with all databases supported by EF  

Disadvantages:  
ùòü A large amount of up-front setup required  

## Conclusion

SQL Functions (option 2) is probably the quickest and easiest one to get up and
running, but if the lack of in-memory support is a deal breaker then writing a
custom SQL function may be worth the extra effort.

As a bonus, this approach could easily be adapted to unlock other SQL features
like soundex or geospatial queries.
